# Diploma Thesis – Trajectory Prediction of Vulnerable Road Users

Daily ArXiv digest focused on trajectory prediction of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) (pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility) in smart intersections, for road safety and autonomous driving applications.

This repository supports:
- literature review
- dataset discovery
- state-of-the-art tracking during thesis work

## Scope
- Pedestrian & cyclist trajectory prediction
- Smart / signalized intersections
- Interaction-aware & risk-aware models
- Autonomous driving perception & prediction
- Road safety analysis
